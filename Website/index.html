                                    <p>A flood resistant building is one that is designed to resist flood water ingress. That means that the building is designed to prevent flood water from entering through the walls, floor and any apertures. The deeper the flood water and the higher the velocity, the more difficult it is to keep water out. As water rises on the outside of the building it creates a force on the ground floor and outside walls including any windows and doors at that level.</p>
